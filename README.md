# Bundle Purchase Simulator (inspired by *544#)

> **Note:** This is a simplified simulation for practice, not the exact live Safaricom menu — menu options and prices vary by line and change over time.

Build a menu-driven program that simulates buying data, SMS, and minutes bundles - similar to dialling a USSD code like `*544#`. This project pulls together everything covered so far: variables & input, conditionals, loops (especially nested `while` loops), functions, and dictionaries.

---

## What You're Building

A program with a main menu and three sub-menus (Data, SMS, Minutes). The user picks a category, then picks a specific bundle, confirms the purchase, and the cost is deducted from a starting balance. The program keeps running until the user chooses Exit.

---

## Starting Data

Use this nested dictionary to store the available bundles. Each category maps to a list of bundles, and each bundle is itself a dictionary:

```python
bundles = {
    "Data": [
        {"name": "50MB - Daily",   "price": 5,   "validity": "24 hours"},
        {"name": "500MB - Weekly", "price": 50,  "validity": "7 days"},
        {"name": "2GB - Monthly",  "price": 200, "validity": "30 days"},
    ],
    "SMS": [
        {"name": "20 SMS - Daily",   "price": 5,  "validity": "24 hours"},
        {"name": "200 SMS - Weekly", "price": 20, "validity": "7 days"},
    ],
    "Minutes": [
        {"name": "10 Min - Daily",    "price": 10,  "validity": "24 hours"},
        {"name": "100 Min - Monthly", "price": 100, "validity": "30 days"},
    ],
}

balance = 200.00   # starting airtime balance in Ksh
```

## Build It — Step by Step

### Step 1
Write a function `main_menu()` that prints the main menu below and returns the user's choice (as a string or int - your choice, just be consistent):

```
========================================
              *544#
========================================
1. Buy Data Bundle
2. Buy SMS Bundle
3. Buy Minutes Bundle
4. Check Balance
5. Exit
========================================
Enter choice (1-5):
```

### Step 2
Write a function `show_bundles(category, bundle_list)` that displays all bundles in a given category, numbered using `enumerate()`, plus a `'0. Back to main menu'` option. For example, calling it with `"Data"` should print:

```
--- DATA BUNDLES ---
1. 50MB - Daily     | Ksh 5   | Valid: 24 hours
2. 500MB - Weekly   | Ksh 50  | Valid: 7 days
3. 2GB - Monthly    | Ksh 200 | Valid: 30 days
0. Back to main menu

Enter choice:
```

### Step 3
Write a function `buy_bundle(category, bundle_list, balance)` that:

- Calls `show_bundles()` in a `while True` loop so the sub-menu keeps showing until the user picks a bundle or goes back
- If the user enters `0`, break out of the loop (back to main menu)
- If the user enters a valid bundle number, show a confirmation prompt: `"Confirm purchase of <name> for Ksh <price>? (y/n):"`
- If confirmed and balance is enough, deduct the price from balance and print a success message with the new balance
- If balance is not enough, print `"Insufficient balance. Please top up."` and do NOT deduct anything
- If the input is invalid (not a number, or out of range), print an error and continue the loop instead of crashing
- Return the (possibly updated) balance

### Step 4
Write a function `check_balance(balance)` that prints: `"Your current balance is Ksh <balance>"` formatted to 2 decimal places.

### Step 5
Write the main program loop: a `while True` loop that calls `main_menu()`, then uses `if/elif/else` to route to the right function based on the choice:

- **1** → call `buy_bundle("Data", bundles["Data"], balance)` and update balance with what it returns
- **2** → same, but for `"SMS"`
- **3** → same, but for `"Minutes"`
- **4** → call `check_balance(balance)`
- **5** → print a goodbye message and break out of the main loop
- **Anything else** → print an error message and continue

## Sample Run (what your program should look and feel like)

```
Enter choice (1-5): 1

--- DATA BUNDLES ---
1. 50MB - Daily     | Ksh 5   | Valid: 24 hours
2. 500MB - Weekly   | Ksh 50  | Valid: 7 days
3. 2GB - Monthly    | Ksh 200 | Valid: 30 days
0. Back to main menu

Enter choice: 2
Confirm purchase of 500MB - Weekly for Ksh 50? (y/n): y
Purchase successful! New balance: Ksh 150.00

Enter choice (1-5): 3

--- MINUTES BUNDLES ---
1. 10 Min - Daily     | Ksh 10  | Valid: 24 hours
2. 100 Min - Monthly  | Ksh 100 | Valid: 30 days
0. Back to main menu

Enter choice: 2
Confirm purchase of 100 Min - Monthly for Ksh 100? (y/n): y
Insufficient balance. Please top up.

Enter choice: 0

Enter choice (1-5): 4
Your current balance is Ksh 150.00

Enter choice (1-5): 5
Thank you for using *544#. Goodbye!
```

## Things to Think About While Building

- You'll have a `while` loop INSIDE another `while` loop (the sub-menu inside the main menu). Be careful which `break` sends you back to the main menu vs. which one exits the whole program.
- Since `balance` can change inside `buy_bundle()`, you need to return it and reassign it in the main loop - a function can't permanently change a variable that was passed to it unless you return the new value and store it.
- Test what happens when balance is exactly equal to the bundle price - should the purchase go through?
- **Bonus (optional):** if you're comfortable with `try/except`, wrap your `input()` calls with it so a non-number entry doesn't crash the whole program - a simple `if`/`isdigit()` check works fine too if you haven't covered `try/except` yet.

> **Tip:** build and test one function at a time in isolation before wiring them into the full menu loop.
